[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/ammobinDOTca/ammobin-classifer.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)

calibre + brand classier for [ammobin.ca](https://ammobin.ca)

## getting started
1. install [https://github.com/creationix/nvm](nvm)
2. ```nvm use```
3. ```npm install```


## todo
- reduce boot up time (currently adds 3s to boot time)
- need to account for how accurate the calibre match is (should have a threshold to return unknown instead)
